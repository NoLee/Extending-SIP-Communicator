SIP Communicator (currentlyt Jitsi) started in 2003 at the University of Strasbourg. It was originally released as an example video phone in the JAIN-SIP stack and later spun off as a standalone project.
It is now a collection of free and open source multiplatform voice (VoIP), videoconferencing and instant messaging applications.

Our project and team goals were:
- Analyze and comprehended the projectsâ€™ predecessor Java code with a view on expanding it.
-	Added novel features including call forwarding, blocking and billing using various **software design patterns**.
- Create and connecting to a team conceptualized relational database (**MySQL**) to demonstrate the above features.
- Create new UI items and intergrate them in the existing UI.
-	Created a **Software Design Document (SDD)** and a **Software Requirements Specification (SRS)** document for the project, along with all the necessary UML diagrams (Class, Case, Collaboration, Sequence, Component, etc).
-	Communicated with the team members efficiently, allocated individual tasks and met strict deadlines.
